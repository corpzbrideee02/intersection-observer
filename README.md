# intersection-observer-api

This simple React application uses the "reveal on scroll" feature and Intersection Observer API. This feature allows specific elements on a webpage to appear or disappear as the user scrolls down, providing a more engaging and interactive user experience. The Intersection Observer API is a recently introduced technology that offers a more efficient and effective way of detecting when an element becomes visible in the viewport compared to older methods.
